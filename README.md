# Template Repository

This serves as the authoritative source of truth for how AI and ML projects should be setup.

## Usage

This can be used as a GitHub repository template, or as a location to store certain best-practice artifacts and configurations for copying over to relevant repositories. Not all configurations and files may be relevant to all repositories, so copy and delete as necessary.

This repository contains artifacts and configurations that mainly target the proper management of Golang, Python, Yaml, Bash, Markdown and JavaScript/TypeScript based repositories. Additional technologies that are language agnostic and covered by this repository include Jupyter, Zarf, Helm, Docker, Makefile, GitHub workflows and actions.
